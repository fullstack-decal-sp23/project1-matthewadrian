        <h1>Matthew Adrian</h1>
        <p>I am a 4th year studying Chemical Engineering @ UC Berkeley looking to 
            transition into Software Engineering/Data Science. I am also a 
            student-athelete on the Cal Ice Hockey team. I learn very quickly 
            and have multiple years of work experience in Chemical Engineering.
            I am also gaining experience in Computer Science/Data Science through 
            classes and multiple projects.

                        Tested and troubleshooted ultrafiltration to remove endotoxin from oligonucleotides 
                        and researched and proposed an affinity chromatography method to managers as an 
                        alternative method for endotoxin removal projecting to save 40+ hours in run time 
                        per batch.

                    <li>
                        Wrote an SOP, IOQ plan, pFMEA, and PQ, conducted impact assessment, and led 
                        Engineering Change Control meetings for the installation and operation of new 
                        laboratory washers and the necessary facilities changes enabling more GMP 
                        compliance and resulting in 4+ hours cycle time reduction per batch of 
                        glassware.
